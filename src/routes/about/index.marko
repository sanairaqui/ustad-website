                            <p>The sitar is a plucked stringed instrument used in Hindustani classical music. The instrument flourished under the Mughals, and it is named after a Persian instrument called the setar (meaning three strings). The sitar flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries and arrived at its present form in 18th-century India. It derives its distinctive timbre and resonance from sympathetic strings, bridge design, a long hollow neck and a gourd-shaped resonance chamber. In appearance, the sitar is similar to the tanpura, except that it has frets.</p>

                                        <h3>Ustad Chhote Rahimat Khan</h3>

                                    <p>
                                            Ustad Chhote Rahimat Khan was born on 4th July 1959 into a musically rich family of renowned sitarists. Belonging to the seventh generation of musicians, his unique heritage has assisted in creating an exceptional performer. He took to the sitar at the age of ten and was trained rigorously by his gifted father, the late Prof. Abdul Karim Khan, who in turn had been tutored by his father, the late Sitar Ratna Rahimat Khan. These two guiding stars of Rahimat's youth, were instrumental in deeply immersing him in the style and values of the 'Beenkar' Bande Ali Khan Gharana of sitar playing. His early years saw him emerging as a promising acolyte of his gharana, when, at the age of 15, he won accolades from a gathering of connoisseurs and music lovers. At 19, he was felicitated at the hands of Late Padmabhushan Dr. Gangubai Hangal for his success in the National Level music competition of All India Radio (A.I.R), Delhi. He is recognised all over India as an approved A graded artist of the A.I.R.

                                    </header>
 <p>Ustad Chhote Rahimat Khan's music has a vibrant blend of Gayaki Ang,with which instrumentalists aspire to imitate the human voice and Layakari, Tantakari Ang, which is the distinctive style of playing the Been. Thus combined with his own creativity and wealth of musical knowledge and understanding,his style of playing is incomparable. He not only did write the score for Goa's first Marathi film 'Vadhachakra' in 1992, and for the Konkani telefilm 'Tulsi' in 1994, but also left his mark on the stage when he composed the score and performed live for Kalidasa's play 'Abhidnyan Shakuntal', staged by Prof. Kamalakar Sontakke. He has enthralled the audiences with numerous concerts across the world.</p>
